## Guidance

Research on guidance focuses on controlling vehicle trajectories to meet specific objectives, such as intercepting targets or following desired paths. Guidance laws leverage relative information, such as position, velocity, and acceleration, to generate commands that adjust the vehicle's flight path effectively. Examples include proportional navigation for precise target interception, pursuit guidance for chasing moving targets, and specialized strategies like deviated or pure pursuit for tactical flexibility.
